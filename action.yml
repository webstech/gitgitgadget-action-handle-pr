  This is a GitHub action to process pull request creates, updates and comments with
  gitgitgadget.  It is used as a workflow dispatch action running in a separate repo.  The
  use case is for repos that will not allow complex github actions in the codebase when
  the github repo is a clone that is used to submit updates to a non-GitHub maintained
  repo.
